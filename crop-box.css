/*
 * HOW-TO:
 *  - Simply include the "crop-box.css" file.
 *  - Add the class ".crop-box" to any HTML elements you want to crop.
 *  That's it and in simple cases, it works well.
 *
 * DRAWBACKS:
 * 1. The '.page' needs to have its "z-index" initialized to a value.
 *    We chose "0". It can be overriden to something else.
 *
 * 2. The '.crop-box' element has to be positionned, either "relative" or
 *    "absolute". So in this CSS, we force to "relative" but it can be overriden
 *    later.

 * 3. The '.crop-box' needs a solid background. Without it, cropping lines would
 *    are visible. It's not forced, document needs to set it explicitly.
 *
 *      Setting 'top/right/bottom/left' to `-1px` have been tried, but it
 *      doesn't work well when printing (or generating a PDF). This reason
 *      explains why there is no ".crop-box-transparent" class/rules.
 *
 * 4. The '.crop-box' will be applied a quite-thick border : white (at printing)
 *    and 10px thick. It's mandatory to avoid cropping lines to join at each
 *    corners. But setting this border makes it a mess to set the object size).
